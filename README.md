# ParmGB
ParmGB is the world's most popular, open-source, Game Boy emulator â€” started by friends of Markus Tech Inc. It is written in GoLang with portability in mind, and we actively maintain builds for Windows and Linux.

In all seriousness, this is a research project between a few friends taking their first jumps into Emulation!

Commits are welcome as we're in extremely early stages of development.

# Dependencies
* Raylib
* A very legally dumped ROM
